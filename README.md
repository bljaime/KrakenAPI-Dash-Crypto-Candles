# Data download with Kraken API, VWAP calculation, interactive visualization with Dash, and deployment with Heroku

This is a first version of a minimalist and naive website for an imaginary cult.

In order to simplify the task, [Cloud9](https://c9.io) has been used, in which I have worked with **node.js** and **express** framework to build the server.

## Quick Start

As I didn't upload the *node_modules* folder, which must contain dependencies, If you want to install them just run the following command:

data_dict_md(
  data,
  title = "",
  description = NA,
  output_file = "data_dict.md",
  output_dir
)


## Heroku app

This is what we visualize when we enter the URL: <p align="center"> <img src="/imgs/screenshot-heroku.PNG"/>
